**[General subject:]{.underline}**

Fragmentation of protoplanetary discs around stars of various mass. How
does the mass of the central object effect the likelihood of
fragmentation?

Constant temperature discs or irradiated discs

**[Specific Subject:]{.underline}**

-   1D and 3D SPH models used to investigate how the stellar mass
    effects the susceptibility of fragmentation with particular focus on
    the critical disc-star mass ratios that support fragmentation.

-   Fragmentation offers an additional mechanism for giant planet
    formation as the timescale for formation of these by core accretion
    may exceed the disc lifetime.

**[Hypothesis:]{.underline}**

If planets on wider orbits are formed by gravitational instability,
fragmentation may be favoured around higher mass stars.

Planets that form through disc fragmentation will be primarily wide
orbit gas giants or brown dwarfs

Fragmentation will occur somewhere between α = 0.01 and α = 0.1

**[Methodology:]{.underline}**

1D disc models from Clarke (2009) and Forgan and Rice (2011), external
radiation included with two cases:

> Constant background temp of 10 K due to irradiation
>
> Stellar irradiation based on stellar models for stars of 0.5Myr age

Testing four star masses (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 solar masses).
Investigating in each instance the conditions needed for fragmentation,
assuming the disc fragments with α \> 0.1

A suite of models is developed for mass accretion rate and outer radius
for e-10 -- e-1 solar mass per year and 1-200 AU, from values for α, Σ
and cs, disc to star mass ratios are calculated for each value of MAR
and Rout.

First case -- Constant background temperature of 10K.

> The disc to star mass predictions may be closer to the true value due
> to the self shielding in the inner disc due to a higher opacity
> causing midplane temps to be a factor of 3-4 times smaller than those
> predicted by the equation (6).

3D SPH simulations use PHANTOM code and the radiative transfer method of
Stamatellos (2007) that is used to probe regions of high and low optical
depths.

500,000 particles are used with disc masses the same as in the 1D
models.

Each disc follows surface density profile with exponent -1.5 and a
temperature profile with exponent -0.5 which were chosen to be
consistent with the 1D models.

Artificial viscosity α = 0.1 β = 0.2

192 10K discs simulated, 58 stellar irradiated discs simulated.

Each disc is evolved to five outer orbital periods with the assumption
that if it has not fragmented by then it won't fragment.

[1D disc models:]{.underline}

Figures 2 and 3 show that fragmentation criteria of 0.01\<α\<0.1 will
require discs whose mass is a significant fraction of the central star.

For fragmentation to occur, the value of q needs to be higher around
lower mass stars that is does for higher mass stars

Disc fragmentation may favour higher mass hosts

[3D disc models:]{.underline}

In the case of 0.25 solar mass fragmentation can occur for lower values
of q that predicted from 1D models. Higher mass stars have results that
are more consistent between the two disc models.

Reinforces the trend that q for fragmentation decreases with increasing
stellar mass and the critical radius for fragmentation shifts outwards.

Results from these 3D models are broadly consistent with those from the
1D models

For a disc that is optically thin, the stellar irradiation has the
potential to totally switch off and supress fragmentation around lower
mass stars but again a totally optically thin disc is unlikely due to
the optial thickness increase in the inner disc.

**[Summary of key points:]{.underline}**

Discs are more prone to fragmentation for higher disc to star mass
ratios

Fragmentation is totally supressed in discs around lower mass stars with
mass ratios approaching unity

Discs around higher mass stars are able to sustain the conditions for
fragmentation for longer than those around lower mass stars.

**[Context]{.underline} (how this article relates to other work in the
field):**

Uses Stamatellos 2007 radiative transfer method -- though I remember him
saying that it is an out of date one that they use.

Their conclusion about fragmentation suppression in discs around low
mass stars with high q values may have important implications for the
model of core accretion (CA) -- these will have large pools of material
available for planet formation which would allow for less strict pebble
accretion efficiency and material depletion in CA models

Dimitris and Anthony Mercer wrote a paper published in Jan 2020 about
disc fragmentation around M Dwarfs -- 0.4 solar mass stars and they said
that the critical mass ratio was around 60%

**[Significance]{.underline} (to work in the field, to my own work):**

Allows me to think about the mass ratios of the discs in my own work,
higher mass discs around a solar mass star are more likely to fragment

Good benchmarks for what to expect

This paper has a very good overview of disc fragmentation in the
introduction, good to read for an literature review
