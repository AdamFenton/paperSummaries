**[Specific Subject:]{.underline}**

Viscous transport of angular momentum

Photoevaporation and discs winds

Comparison of externally driven mass-loss rate with the accretion rate
onto the central object

**[Hypothesis / Question:]{.underline}**

A disc population that has been depleted by external photoevaporation
can be used to inform the transport of angular momentum in the outer
regions of the disc

**[Methodology:]{.underline}**

[Stellar Dynamical Model]{.underline}

> NBody 6 ++ code (1974) using a star position distribution from Plummer
> profile
>
> Kroupa IMF with total stellar mass of 150 Msun with a 17 Msun mass
> star at the center of the region
>
> Maxwellian velocity distribution with dispersion chosen such that the
> population is in virial equilibrium

[Disc Evolution]{.underline}

> Initial disc mass of 0.1 M_star with a viscous α of e-3 which is kept
> constant to be consistent with the radial dependence of viscosity
>
> Evolution is followed until the disc mass falls below e-5 Msun when it
> is considered dispersed.
>
> **Used LINMIX package for bayesian linear regression**

**[Result(s):]{.underline}**

Comparisons of observed dust masses with those obtained from the model
at 2 Myr show that the discs have not undergone sufficient depletion to
draw a clear gradient in disc mass. After 5 Myrs the depletion is close
to observation but disc masses in the model are greater than
observations by a factor of \~2.

Assume that the mass flux outwards is comparable to the accretion rate
onto the central star. This is shown in figure 3 where the wind induced
mass loss rate is approximately the same as the accretion rate on to the
star.

For older disc populations, the mass accretion rate is a strong
indicator for the rate of photoevaporation is viscous diffusion is
active.

If indications imply that wind induced mass loss rate (Mwind) is far
less than the mass accretion rate, discs are not subjected to viscous
diffusion.

For young stellar populations the PPDs are subject to rapid truncation
such that wind induced mass loss rate is far greater than the mass
accretion rate. These have been traditional targets for observations.

Mwind and Macc both correlate with the disc mass and the host mass.
Shown in figure 4. These models predict that the disc outer radius is
linked to the mass accretion rate.

Neither Mwind or Macc are correlated with the distance to the 17 Msun
star at the centre of the region.

Macc increased with increasing Mdisc and maximum Mdisc increases with
increasing distance from 17Msun star.

**Assumptions made:**

Dust to gas ratio of e-2

Ignored internal disc dispersal mechanics (Magnetic winds etc)

Fixed viscous α at e-3

Νο prescription for the effect if interstellar extinction that may cause
disc UV shielding

**[Summary of key points:]{.underline}**

Model presented reproduces the observed disc mass distribution
suggesting that it may be a reasonable mechanism for the depletion of
material around stars.

No strong gradient in the externally driven depletion of the inner disc
but this does not necessarily imply that the external photoevaporation
has a negligible effect on the PPDs in the region.

**[Context]{.underline} (how this article relates to other work in the
field):**

Comparisons of their model to observations and offers a novel way of
investigating the transfer of angular momentum.

Inform future observations regarding which targets should be prioritised
to constrain the wind induced mass loss rate for a population of
depleted PPDs. The targets should be the most massive discs around the
most massive stars with the highest accretion rates that are closest to
the ionising source.

**[Significance]{.underline} (to work in the field, to my own work):**

Discussion of Macc relation to various disc parameters that may be
useful to know going forward, specifically the info in figure 4 and the
preceding section.
