Smoothed particle hydrodynamics

Artificial viscosity

Keplerian accretion discs

**[Specific Subject:]{.underline}**

Balsara Switch

Time dependant viscosity

The ring test to quantify to effective viscosity

**[Hypothesis / Question:]{.underline}**

Is the standardised method of controlling viscosity with a time
dependant viscosity (TDV) and the Balsara switch (BS) sufficient in
Keplerian accretion discs?

**[Methodology:]{.underline}**

The ring test is performed with and without TDV and BS using SEREN

8e4 particles with a total mass of 0.1 solar masses using a gaussian
distribution for the surface density about a maximum at 10 AU around a 1
solar mass star in a Keplerian orbit

Evolution is only allowed under the influence of the star's gravity and
artificial viscosity

Simulated for 200 years

Viscosity α varied between 0.1 and 1 while β was kept constant at zero

**[Result(s):]{.underline}**

The disc evolution was not smooth, with the central density oscillating
as the ring evolved.

The central density fell more rapidly and the ring spread more quickly
with higher values of α

If BS and TDV are effective in turning off artificial viscosity in shear
flow, then dΣ should be zero. Turning on BS did reduce the value of dΣ,
as did TDV but not by as much.

Both BS and TDV introduce prograde alignments in the disc, producing
only slightly fewer alignments than in the cases where both switched
were turned off
