**[Key Words]:**

accretion; accretion disks; formation; planets and satellites;
protoplanetary disks; surveys

**[General subject:]**

Assumptions made by planet synthesis population models

Comparison of mass accretion rate between observation and models

Mass accretion rate versus disc mass

**[Specific Subject:]**

Applicability of the current disc models that predict the mass accretion
rates

**[Hypothesis / Question:]**

Are the currently used disc models sufficient in predicting viscous disc
evolution in terms of accretion rate?

**[Methodology:]**

Assuming a central star of one solar mass

Snapshot at time equivalent to 2 Myrs to compare with the observational
data

At this age, \<10% of the modelled discs have dissipated
