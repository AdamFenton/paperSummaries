**[General subject:]{.underline}**

Viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs

Discs winds

Chemical tracing to determine disc extent

**[Specific Subject:]{.underline}**

Spreading of the disc due to viscous evolution

How does the value of α effect the change in disc extent?

**[Hypothesis / Question:]{.underline}**

How does the gas outer radius changes with time is a disc undergoing
viscous evolution?

Does episodic accretion, photoevaporation and grain surface chemistry CO
depletion effect the results?

**[Methodology:]{.underline}**

Observationally informed initial conditions are evolved viscously using
DALI (thermodynamical code)

Observed gas disc is measured from observations of the CO(2-1) line
which encloses 90% of the radius

Find time evolution of the surface density profile using equations from
Hartmann 1998

[Assume that the disc evolves viscously]{.underline}

0.1, 0.32 and 1 solar masses

Characteristic radius of 10AU

α-values of e-2,e-3,e-4

Assuming a gaussian density distribution for the vertical structure.

[Time evolution of the CO(2-1) emission profile]{.underline}

> Determined by viscous spreading, decrease in disc mass over time and
> CO being converted into others at longer times
>
> Higher values of α More rapid spreading. α of 0.01 lrads to CO
> emission spreading from 200 AU to 400 AU within 1Myr. After 2 Myrs the
> CO column densities are low enough to be removed by photodissociation
> which does not occur in discs with α of e-3 and e-4 in which cases the
> CO column density never gets low enough
>
> For a higher mass star, the disc masses are greater and column
> densities are systematically higher so photodissociation has little
> effect as it does with lower mass stars. Disc sizes are more similar
> across the different values of α.

**[Summary of key points:]{.underline}**

Observed outer radius increases with time and is larger for greater
values of α.
