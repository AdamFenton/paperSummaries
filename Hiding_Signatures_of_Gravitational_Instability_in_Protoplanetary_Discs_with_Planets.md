**[Key Words]{.underline}:**

planet-disc interactions; protoplanetary discs

**[General subject:]{.underline}**

-   SPH simulations (PHANTOM)

-   Disc structure (spirals)

-   Gravitational instability

**[Specific Subject:]{.underline}**

The impact of **the presence of a giant planet** on the
breakdown/retention of spiral structure in protoplanetary discs.

The effect of **the presence of a giant planet** on the value of the
Toomre parameter, Q.

Gas kinematics of CO can be used to detect planets.

**[Hypothesis / Question:]{.underline}**

Spiral arms in midplane of protoplanetary discs are rare. Is this
because the young discs are less massive or because spiral structure is
being supressed/hidden?

**[Methodology:]{.underline}**

Run SPH simulations in PHANTOM using the CD10 switch for artificial
viscosity. Discs of 2e6 particles are constructed between R = 1 and R =
25 with a disc mass to star mass ratio of 0.1.

H/R at R0 is 0.05 where R0 = 1AU. This determines the temperature
profile by determining T0.

Simple cooling time is used (gammie beta parmeter). They do note that a
more realistic RT model may have an effect on the long term
gravitational stability of the disc when a migrating planet is included.

They allow 10 orbits to pass so spirals can develop before embedding a
planet with planet to star mass of 2.9E-3 at R =20AU. The simulations
are then run for another 8 orbits.

Simulations are also scales out so that R_out = 200 AU and R_p = 160 AU

**[Result(s):]{.underline}**

-   Planet supresses spiral structure and opens gap

-   With a planet, the disc has Q \> 1.7 throughout meaning it is
    gravitationally stable

    -   This is due to the influence of the planet on the temperature of
        the disc. The wakes of the planet can propagate into shocks
        which heat the disc due to the exchange of momentum and energy
        between these wakes and the disc

-   Without a planet, the spiral arms are present and are strongly
    gravitationally unstable.

-   At radii greater than R = 120 AU there is a significant increase in
    sound speed (temperature proxy), this causes the toomre parameter to
    increase and hence stabilise the disc.

-   The inclusion of the planet did not increase the artificial
    viscosity by much, this means there is no artificial excessive
    heating.

-   Also find that optically thinner C\^13 O\^16 shows evidence of
    planet as kink in Keplerian flow.

**[Summary of key points:]{.underline}**

-   **The presence of a planet supresses spiral structure and increases
    Q towards stability by increasing the temperature of the disc due to
    the interactions between the wakes of the planet and the disc**

-   **Self gravitating phase is shortened by the presence of a planet
    (at R = 160AU in a 200 AU disc)**

**[Context]{.underline} (how this article relates to other work in the
field):**

The results of this paper seem to be in contrast to the results of Meru
(2015) where they show that the presence of a fragment formed by
gravitations instability in the outer regions of a disc can trigger
fragmentation at lower radii. That being said, the profiles for the
toomre parameter in both studies are different:

The inner disc in Meru (2015) had a low value for Q ( \~1) and was
therefore already on the brink of fragmentation.

**[Significance]{.underline} (to work in the field, to my own work):**

It will be interesting to see what happens further down the line when I
come to run simulations of disc that have some fragmentation in them.
