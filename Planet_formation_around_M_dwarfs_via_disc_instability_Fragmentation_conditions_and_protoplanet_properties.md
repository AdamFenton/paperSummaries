and the fragment properties

**[Specific Subject:]{.underline}**

Formation of planets by disc fragmentation around M dwarf stars (up to
around 0.5 solar masses)

Properties of the planets that form by disc fragmentation around low
mass stars

GANDALF SPH code with Cullen and Dehnen artificial viscosity treatment

**[Hypothesis:]{.underline}**

Giant planets around M Dwarfs are prime candidates to have formed
through disc instability

**[Methodology:]{.underline}**

GANDALF SPH code used to model the hydrodynamics of the systems

Cullen and Dehnen 2010 treatment of artificial viscosity to turn down
viscosity away from shocks

Hydrodynamical simulations with various stellar mass, metallicity and
disc radii and an increasing disc mass until the disc fragments thus
finding the minimum mass for fragmentation -- method they call Mass
Loading (section 2.2)

2 million particles

A total of 27 simulations are performed, each initially gravitationally
stable but through the mass loading process they become unstable and
spiral arms develop

**[Result(s):]{.underline}**

When a disc fragments, the disc mass gives the minimum mass for disc
fragmentation and the time of fragmentation.

Fragmentation occurs in the first few tens of kyrs at distances greater
than 30 au from the host (most likely is between 50 and 60 au) which is
closer than the fragmentation radius in discs around more massive stars
This agrees with the expectation that disc that are around less massive
stars fragment at a smaller radius. (Whitworth & Stamatellos 2006).

Smaller discs fragment at a lower mass

The disc fragmentation mass increased with initial disc radius

Large disc masses are required for fragmentation around M dwarfs

Changing the metalicity of the disc has little effect on the disc
fragmentation mass for the disc with the same size.

Disc evolution is effected by metalicity -- when the disc metallicity is
lower the disc exhibits well defined but weaker spiral arms which take
longer to fragment due to more gas being required to attain an optical
depth of 1 where cooling is the most efficient.

Stars that host gravitational unstable discs have a higher accretion
rate due to angular momentum being transferred outwards by gravitational
torques, prior to this, when the disc is stable, the transport of
angular momentum happens much slower.

**[Summary of key points:]{.underline}**

Fragmentation around M dwarfs requires disc to star mass ratio (q) of
between 0.3 and 0.6 depending on the size of the disc with larger discs
requiring a larger q

Mass at which the disc fragments increases with size and mass of host
star

No fragmentation in smaller discs around more massive M Dwarfs due to
strong spiral features.

Smaller discs around low mass MDs are most susceptible to fragmentation

Disc metallicity doesn't have large effect on disc fragmentation mass

Protoplanets around MD form w/i a few thousand years

Disc instability is a viable mechanism for the formation of giant gas
planets round MDs where core accretion would be insufficient.

**[Context]{.underline} (how this article relates to other work in the
field):**

Agrees with previous work that suggested that fragmentation can only
occurs in the outer regions of extended discs.

**[Significance]{.underline} (to work in the field, to my own work):**

They do not follow the protoplanet past the formation of the second core
due to computational constraints. They suggest that a more detailed
treatment of the protoplanet past this stage is required rather than the
typical sink particles. This is one of the things I am improving on in
my research.
