**[General subject:]**

Disc fragmentation in accretion discs

Lower limits of disc quantities such as mass and size that allow for
disc fragmentation to occur

**[Specific Subject:]**

Determination of the lower limits of disc fragmentation and compare them
with observed properties to assess the likelihood of this formation
mechanism occurring in nature.

Discs are observable with the current (2011) capabilities

SEREN is used for the hydrodynamic simulations

**[Hypothesis / Question:]**

A large number of observed brown dwarfs form by disc fragmentation as a
result of gravitational instability in planet forming discs.

What are the lowest requirements of a disc such that it meets the
criteria for disc fragmentation?

**[Methodology:]**

Star mass is 0.7 solar masses with disc mass and radius as free params
b/w 0.15-0.3 solar masses and 60au -- 150au respectively

Σ radial exponent, p, is set to one so that there is equal mass per unit
radius and q, the temp profile exponent is set to either 0.5 or 0.75

Time dependant artificial viscosity with α = 0.1 and β=2\*alpha with
Balsara switch turned on to turn down viscosity away from shocks

Stamatellos 2007a radiative transfer method is used

1.5e5 particles are used which has been shown to be an effective number
to resolve the jeans mass and vertical disc temperature profile

Hydrodynamic simulations are used to investigate the lower limits of
disc properties that will still allow for disc fragmentation

**[Result(s):]**

Gravitational instabilities develop in all the simulations ran, some of
which grow stronger and cause the fragmentation of the disc within a few
thousand years while in others they weaken, resulting in an axisymmetric
disc

Discs are followed for 40kyrs or 10 outer orbital periods to ensure the
instabilities have enough time to develop

Discs transfer angular momentum and spread from an initial size of
60-100 au to around 200 au

As with the simulations in Stamatellos and Whitworth 2009a, the first
object to form by fragmentation migrates inwards, accreting material and
becoming a low mass hydrogen burning star while the objects that form
later form father out and are planets or BDs. These are candidates for
ejection from the system which is what happens to the only planetary
mass object formed here.

In the cases where the disc fragments, its mass and extent after 40kyr
is greatly reduced (0.002 -- 0.07 solar masses and 20 -- 70 AU
respectively.

Those that do not fragment transfer angular momentum, the inner disc is
accreted onto the central star and the outer material expands outward
initially quickly but slows down as the disc becomes more stable

The assumption that p = 1 may not being limiting since it has been
suggested that it may go as low as 0.4. This would result in a less
steep density profile

A steeper temperature profile ( q = 0.75 was used here for the most
part) but observations suggest that q might be as high as 0.8 which
would result in discs being cooler and hence more unstable.

The values of p and q for the points above are not certain so there is
room for further expansion of this work to investigate a large area of
parameter space

There is also the possibility that discs around lower mass stars
fragment and that passing stars trigger fragmentation due to
gravitational interactions.

**[Summary of key points:]**

Discs of moderate size (100 au, 0.25 solar mass) around a 0.7 solar mass
star (disk-star ratio of 0.36). These values are lower than previous
expectations and by be even lower if a wider parameter space is studied.

Most objects form BDs but low mass HB stars and planets also form

Fewer objects form in smaller discs

Fragmentation happens on dynamical timescale so fragmenting discs are
rarely observed

The discs that do not undergo fragmentation later dissipate on the
viscosity time scale (1 Myr)

If massive discs do not fragment they should be observed which is not
the case, this is either because the fragmentation occurs quickly
following formation or the fragmentation is supressed, by magnetic
fields for example

The final mass and radius of fragmented discs are both dramatically
reduced as mass is contained within the objects that form.

**[Context] (how this article relates to other work in the
field):**

Pushes the expected lower limits of disc fragmentation to lower masses
and lower disc sizes. It shows that even low mass discs are able to
fragment and opens up the question of even lower limits as discussed in
§2.4

**[Significance] (to work in the field, to my own work):**

Simulations that I run may be unlikely to form lower mass objects in the
planetary regime but their formation is possible on the outer fringes of
discs.

**[Other Comments:]**

There is a section (§3) that discusses the processing of synthetic
fragmenting discs and comparing them with observations which is worth a
read for understanding how the process was carried out but I have
excluded the points §3 in this summary.
